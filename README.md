# **Scarab Discord Bot**



#### This is my repository for the custom discord SCARAB bot.

### I grant access to use my code, to use and edit. **Please do not pass it along as your own.**

Discord.py has been discontinued, and I may or may not update with a new package such as hikari. Please note that features in this bot will be outdated: buttons, slash commands are not able to be added with discord.py.

Please see the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Soulsender/scarabbot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for updates. 

If you have a bug report, or a request for something to be added, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/Soulsender/scarabbot/issues) tab.
