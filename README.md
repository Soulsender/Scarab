# **Scarab Discord Bot**
<img src="design.png">

#### Please use the v1.0.2 release **not** the pycord one, as pycord is incredibly buggy in it's current state, and discord.py v1.3.7 is the only reliable API wrapper at this time.


**I grant access to use my code, to use and edit. Please do not pass it along as your own.**

As of v2, Scarab now uses the pycord API.

If you have a bug report, or a request for something to be added, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/Soulsender/scarabbot/issues) tab.
