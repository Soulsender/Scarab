# **Scarab Discord Bot**



#### This is my repository for the custom discord SCARAB bot.

### I grant access to use my code, to use and edit. **Please do not pass it along as your own.** I have included my tutorial sources below.

Please see the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Soulsender/scarabbot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for updates.

If you have a bug report, or a request for something to be added, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/Soulsender/scarabbot/issues) tab.

### **Features**
- Dice rolling with multiple dice, and dice types such as;
  - D20
  - D6
  - D100
  - etc.

- Insults using detailed randomly generated API.
- Admin tools such as purging, banning, kicking. These are actived if a user has the @Bot Admin role, which is created when the bot joins the server. 

- **(WIP)** Minecraft custom marketplace to coodinate selling and buying of ingame items and trade offers.
- **(WIP)** Possibility to link a minecraft bedrock server. **(At the moment this feature is suspended, as I have only implemented my own server and not the ability to add your own.)**

### **Usage**
Currently, the bot is in alpha, and not ready to be deployed. Once it it, I will update this statment.
