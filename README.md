# **Scarab Discord Bot**
This is my repository for the custom discord SCARAB bot.

### I grant access to use my code, to use and edit. **Please do not pass it along as yours.** I have included my tutorial sources below.

Please see the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Soulsender/scarabbot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for updates.

If you have a bug report, or a request for something to be added, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/Soulsender/scarabbot/issues) tab.

### **Features**
- Dice rolling with multiple dice, and dice types such as;
  - D20
  - D6
  - D100
  - etc.
- **(WIP)** Possibility to link a minecraft bedrock server. **(At the moment this feature is suspended, as I have only implemented my own server and not the ability to add your own.)**
- Insults using detailed randomly generated API.
- **(WIP)** Admin tools. **(These have been temporaily disabled until I add a limitation on users with access.)**
- **(WIP)** Minecraft custom marketplace to coodinate selling and buying of ingame items and trade offers.
- Custom server-specific prefixes to make more viable with other bots.
